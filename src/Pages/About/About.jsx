                        My most recent work involved designing user-centric solutions in the hospitality and energy management industries for <span className='text-[#DD0101] font-semibold'>Centralogic.</span> I also contributed to flagship projects like HRMS and CRM systems, ensuring a balance between user needs and business goals. My approach emphasizes crafting seamless and engaging interfaces, leveraging my expertise in UX/UI design for software products. Prior to this, I honed my design sensibilities through five years of experience in architecture and interior design, where I cultivated a deep appreciation for form, function, and spatial harmonyâ€”a perspective that continues to enhance my work today.

                        I graduated from <span className="font-semibold text-[#DD0101]">Nagpur University in India</span> with a

                        The skills I developed in architecture, such as spatial awareness, problem-solving, and a keen eye for detail, have greatly enhanced my UX/UI design work. I applied these architectural principles alongside my UX/UI training in both classroom project and at Centralogic, merging form, function, and user-centered design to create impactful experiences.

                        Born and raised in <span className='text-[#DD0101] font-semibold'>India</span>, I've always been inspired by vibrant cultures, and that energy reflects in my designs. Outside of work, I'm a traveler with an insatiable curiosity, a hobbyist chef exploring culinary adventures, and an artist who finds solace in painting. You might also catch me breaking a sweat during a workout session or soaking in new experiences across Malaysia.
